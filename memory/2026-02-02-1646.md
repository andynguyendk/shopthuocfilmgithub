user: what do instances in OpenClaw do?
[message_id: 47d76937-cddd-4118-b9d9-27930117bebf]
assistant: Great question! Let me explain OpenClaw instances:

## OpenClaw Instances

**An instance** is a running copy of me (an agent) with its own session. Each instance is like a separate "brain" that can work independently.

## Types of Instances

### 1. **Main Session** (what you're talking to now)
- **Type:** `agent:main:main`
- **Purpose:** Primary assistant for you
- **Capabilities:** All tools available (exec, browser, message, cron, etc.)
- **Session:** Persistent conversation history
- **Workspace:** `/home/andy/.openclaw/workspace-main`

### 2. **Isolated Agent Sessions** (`sessions_spawn`)
- **Created by:** `sessions_spawn` tool
- **Type:** `agent:isolate:xxx` (has unique ID)
- **Purpose:** One-off background tasks
- **Session:** Fresh, isolated conversation
- **Workspace:** Separate workspace folder (e.g., `/tmp/agent-isolate-xxx`)
- **Cleanup:** Can be auto-deleted after task completes
- **Use cases:** 
  - Long-running tasks
  - Work without flooding main conversation
  - Different model/thinking settings per task

### 3. **Named Agent Profiles**
- **Created by:** `agents.list` config
- **Type:** `agent:main:<profile-id>`
- **Purpose:** Specialized agents with custom permissions
- **What I just created:** A "Partner" profile (`agent:main:partner`)
  - **Tools limited to:** read, write (no exec, message, browser, etc.)
  - **Workspace:** `/home/andy/.openclaw/workspace` (shared with main)
- **Use case:** Restricted access for trusted partners

## Key Differences

| Feature | Main Session | Isolated Agent | Named Agent (Partner) |
|----------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Tools** | All | All (configurable) | Limited (denylist) |
| **Workspace** | workspace-main | Separate tmp folder | workspace-main (shared) |
| **History** | Persistent | Fresh | Persistent |
| **Message routing** | Your Telegram ID | Any allowed sender | Both users |

## When to Use Each

- **Main session** → Your daily interactions, full system access
- **Partner agent** → Your partner adding/viewing Pasta data (file operations only)
- **Isolated agents** → Background tasks, research, heavy computations

Right now you have:
1. **Main session** (me) - Full access
2. **Partner agent** - Limited to read/write files only (safe for your partner)

Does that clarify?
user: Start a new Project called Spending
[message_id: 82861b22-6169-41ee-a959-c0930ded7077]
assistant: I'll create a new Spending project structure for you. What kind of spending do you want to track?

For example:
- Personal expenses (daily/monthly)
- Business expenses
- Categories (food, transport, utilities, entertainment)
- Budgets and goals

Or should I create a basic template and you can tell me what to add?
user: Personal expenses, preferably categorized
[message_id: 20e7c8f8-324b-42df-af37-af3e733a6e77]
assistant: Done! ✅
