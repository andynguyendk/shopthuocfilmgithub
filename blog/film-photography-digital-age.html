            <h1>Film Photography in the Digital Age</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>In a world where we carry high-resolution cameras in our pockets 24/7, analog photography is making an unexpected comeback. Film, once considered obsolete, is now experiencing a renaissance — and the numbers tell the story.</p>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <div class="stat">
                    <div class="stat-number">+72%</div>
                    <div class="stat-label">Film sales growth since 2015</div>
                </div>
                <div class="stat">
                    <div class="stat-number">50M+</div>
                    <div class="stat-label">Film rolls sold annually worldwide</div>
                </div>
                <div class="stat">
                    <div class="stat-number">200+</div>
                    <div class="stat-label">New film stocks introduced since 2010</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Why the Comeback?</h2>

            <h3>Deliberate Process</h3>
            <p>Digital photography is instant — often too instant. We snap hundreds of photos without thinking, rarely looking at them again. Film forces you to slow down. Each frame costs money, so you compose more carefully. You think about light, subject, and story before pressing the shutter.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "With film, you're not just taking a picture — you're making an image. There's intentionality in every frame."
            </div>

            <h3>Tangibility</h3>
            <p>There's something magical about holding a physical negative. A negative is not just an image file that can be deleted with a click. It's a physical object, a piece of light-captured history that can last for generations if stored properly.</p>

            <h3>The Surprise Factor</h3>
            <p>Digital cameras let you review every shot immediately. Film keeps you guessing. You shoot, wait for development, and then discover what you captured. That anticipation, the joy of the unexpected good shot — it's an experience digital can't replicate.</p>

            <h3>Aesthetic Quality</h3>
            <p>Look at any modern film on Instagram or TikTok, and you'll notice the difference. Film has a certain look — organic grain, natural color rendition, a feeling of depth that's hard to fake with filters. It's not "better" objectively, but many photographers find it more pleasing.</p>

            <h2>New Film Renaissance</h2>

            <p>The film industry was written off in the 2000s, but it never died. Now, it's thriving:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kodak brought back Ektachrome:</strong> The iconic slide film returned to production in 2018 after being discontinued.</li>
                <li><strong>Fujifilm keeps innovating:</strong> Despite ending some lines, they still produce beloved stocks like Pro 400H and C200.</li>
                <li><strong>New manufacturers:</strong> Companies like CineStill, Lomography, and Film Ferrania are creating fresh emulsions.</li>
                <li><strong>Rescued classics:</strong> Orphaned film stocks are being purchased and brought back to life by small labs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Modern Hybrid Approach</h2>

            <p>You don't have to choose sides. Many photographers blend both worlds:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shoot film, scan digitally:</strong> Capture on film, process at a lab or at home, then scan for online sharing.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid darkrooms:</strong> Develop negatives yourself, then scan them for digital editing in Lightroom or Photoshop.</li>
                <li><strong>Film emulation:</strong> Shoot digital with film looks applied, while still shooting actual film for special occasions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Scanning: Your Bridge to the Web</h3>
            <p>Modern scanning has revolutionized film accessibility. You can buy a high-quality flatbed scanner for under $200, or even use your smartphone with specialized apps. Once scanned, your film images live alongside your digital ones — shared on Instagram, backed up to the cloud, printed at home.</p>

            <h2>Getting Started Today</h2>

            <h3>Equipment</h3>
            <p>You don't need expensive gear to start:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cameras:</strong> Pentax K1000, Canon AE-1, Nikon FM2 — legendary bodies that sell for $100-300.</li>
                <li><strong>Film:</strong> Kodak Gold 200 and ColorPlus are affordable starter films at $10-15 per roll.</li>
                <li><strong>Development:</strong> Send to a lab ($8-15 per roll) or develop yourself with our <a href="/products/">chemicals</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Community</h3>
            <p>The analog community is incredibly welcoming. Reddit's r/analog, Instagram hashtags like #shootfilmmovement, and local camera meetups are everywhere. People share tips, trade gear, and help beginners. You're never alone in this journey.</p>

            <h2>The Cost Question</h2>

            <p>Yes, film costs more per shot. But consider this:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A roll of film might cost $15 and give you 36 shots. That's about $0.42 per photo.</li>
                <li>A $1000 digital camera costs $0 per photo after purchase. But how many photos do you actually keep?</li>
                <li>Film forces you to be selective. You might shoot 100 frames in a day and keep 20. Digital shooters might shoot 1000 and keep 20.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Value isn't just about per-shot cost. It's about the experience, the learning, and the photos you actually treasure.</p>

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>

            <p>Film isn't going anywhere. In fact, it's more accessible than ever:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labs are reopening:</strong> Many cities have multiple dedicated film labs now.</li>
                <li><strong>Online communities:</strong> Tutorials, forums, and marketplaces make learning easy.</li>
                <li><strong>Supplies are plentiful:</strong> You can buy film, chemicals, and equipment online with next-day delivery.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Turn</h2>

            <p>Whether you're completely new to photography or a digital veteran looking to try something different, there's never been a better time to start shooting film.</p>

            <p>Pick up an old camera, buy a roll of film, and go make some images. Don't worry about perfect exposure or composition. Just shoot. Develop the roll. Hold the negatives in your hands.</p>

            <p>You might just discover something you've been missing: the joy of the process itself.</p>

            <h2>The End of an Era? Or a New Beginning?</h2>

            <p>Some called film obsolete. Others said it was dead. But photographs made on film today will still be viewable in 100 years. Can you say the same about your JPEGs stored on a cloud server that might not exist next year?</p>

            <p>Maybe that's the real appeal of film. In our throwaway digital culture, film offers permanence. It offers a connection to photography's roots. It offers a slower, more intentional way of seeing the world.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                "Every photograph is a moment frozen in time. Film makes that moment something you can hold in your hands. That's magic."
