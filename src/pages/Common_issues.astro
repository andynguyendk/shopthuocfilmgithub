Here is the list of some common issues one could encounter when developing films. The list is, by no means, exhaustive and definitive.
It only serves as a quick reference for troubleshooting. The aim is to point you in the hopefully direction so you don't have to keep scratching
your head in frustration and looking for issues in the wrong places.
